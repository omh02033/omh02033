Hello, I am Oh Myeong-hoon, a 24th at Sejong University in Seoul.

I'm a web full stack developer who does his best to provide the most comfortable service. These days, I am studying to provide services not only on the web but also on mobile.

I'm thinking a lot about security, too! "**How do you make your customers as secure as they can without being bothered?**" It's a constant concern. I'm trying hard to find a solution to this problem!

Skills: Next.js / Express.js / Electron.js / React Native
